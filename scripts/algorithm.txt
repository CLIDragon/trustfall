### Attempt 1
Start by reading from top to bottom. Ignore some calls.
For each Yield call, 
	if it is a YieldFrom(ResolveStartingVertices), it must be followed by a YieldInto and belongs to that YieldInto
	if it is a YieldInto that has the same parent as the next YieldFrom,
then it belongs to that YieldFrom. 
	if it is a YieldFrom followed by a YieldInto, it belongs to that YieldInto

For each AdvanceInputIterator
	if it is preceded by a YieldFrom with the same parent.
		Then the following operations belong to the AdvanceInputIterator and the AdvanceInputIterator belongs to the next YieldInto with a different parent that comes after a YieldFrom of the same parent. 

	if not, then I don't know - enum_mussing_ptrace.txt does not have enough info to decide.


Assumptions: 
	(1) No adjacent YieldInto calls. 
	(2) YieldInto is always followed by a YieldFrom.
	(2a) A YieldFrom is always preceded by a YieldInto, unless it is a YieldFrom(ResolveStartingVertices) or YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsInner)
	(2b) If a YieldFrom follows a YieldFrom, then it must be a YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsOuter) followed by a YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsInner) 
	(2b*) Unless there is a AdvanceInputIterator in between.
	(2c) Conversely, YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsOuter) must always be followed by any number of Calls and an equal number of AdvanceInputIterators, and then a YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsInner) or an OutputIteratorExhausted. (.e. YF C C A A YF is ok, but YF C A C YF is not).
	(2d) YieldInto always has the same parent as its following YieldFrom

	(3) A YieldFrom followed by a YieldInto must have different parents.
	(4) A YieldFrom(ResolveStartingVertices) must be followed by a YieldInto.
	(5) Everything but Call must have a valid parent.
	(6) Operation ids are unique and chronologically ordered.
	(7) YieldFrom(ResolveNeighborsInner) is always followed by a YieldInto or OutputIteratorExhausted
	(7a) If it's followed by an OutputIteratorExhausted, then that must be followed by a YieldInto with a different parent.
